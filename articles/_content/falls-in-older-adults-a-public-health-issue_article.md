Recently, I received a voice message reiterating the statistic that 1-in-3 older adults are at risk to fall. The company that left the message was selling a home-alert system to help those who have fallen receive help to get up.

Similarly, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a television commercial made the catchphrase, “I've fallen and I can't get up” popular. Many people wittily repeated the phrase whenever anyone fell.

It was amusing, but the reason for the device was not: An elderly person, alone in her home, fell and couldn’t get up. The commercial advertised a product worn around the neck that when activated, would alert a dispatch service that the subscriber needed help.

Both products are inventive, but not pre-emptive. Sending help to a person who has fallen is supportive, but preventing a fall is paramount.

Fall prevention is essential because an estimated 27,0000 senior citizens die each year due to complications following a fall, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention1. Complications ensue when a person falls hard enough to break a bone, incur a laceration, or head trauma. Head trauma and infection can lead to death. Moreover, the reason a person falls is also a considerable factor. Did she have an ischemic episode? Does he suffer from neuropathy and tripped as opposed to losing his balance?  Is her eyesight failing?

### Cost of Falling

In 2000, the [Lewin Group for AARP’s Public Policy Institute](https://assets.aarp.org/rgcenter/il/ib56_falls.pdf) (PPI) analyzed the incidence and cost of fall injuries that lead to an emergency-room visit2. Its focus was on the incidence, and direct medical and long-term care cost of falls in each state among people 65 and older.

The results were staggering: 34.7 million people, with an estimated 1.8 million emergency-room visits due to falls, equaled an average cost per fall of approximately $9,400, of which only 25 percent was paid by private insurance or by the patient. The other 75 percent was paid by Medicare, and state and federal Medicaid funds.

But the cost reaches farther than monetary value.

### First fall can lead to second fall

If the reason for the first fall goes undiagnosed, a patient will more than likely fall again. According to a draft recommendation statement by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a “history of falls was the one factor that consistently identified persons at high risk for falls.”<sup>3</sup>

Subsequently, the second episode could instigate a fear of falling and loss of independence, leading to a downward spiral into depression and isolation.

Likewise, in a 2015 telephone survey4 of 1,650 interviewees conducted by the United States on Aging, 40 percent of older adults stated that maintaining their physical health was their main priority.

### Preventing falls first

Falls are not an inevitable effect of aging. Exercise, Tai Chi, and yoga are all excellent ways to increase balance and agility among citizens of the senior set. Numerous organizations provide recreational, occupational, and remedial programs to them.

Prior to signing up, patients should speak with their health-care providers about a fall-risk evaluation. Doctors who regularly monitor their older patients’ medication, vision, hearing, and proprioception -- the sense of your body’s parts and their relationship of movement – are acting preventively. They are making sure that their patients can see what’s in front of them, that they don’t have inner-ear issues that would cause vertigo or imbalance, and that all the patient’s body parts are working in unison.

They also watch as their patients walk down the hall, and sit in and rise from a chair unassisted, all of which can indicate balance concerns. If the patient’s balance issues are not medical, the doctor might recommend an orthosis – a corrective device.

### Shoes and braces

Numerous companies today offer therapeutic shoes and orthotic braces that help patients feel in control of their bodies and its balance, so that they don't fall in the first place.

Patients should speak with a podiatrist about what she would recommend in a shoe and/or brace.

Podiatrists are doctors of podiatric medicine, DPMs, who diagnose and treat conditions of the foot, ankle, and related structures of the leg, according to the APMA (American Podiatric Medical Association).
