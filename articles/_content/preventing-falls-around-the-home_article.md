Taking a tumble is never fun, but when you are older, it can be positively frightening and possibly life-threatening. A fall can put you at risk of losing your mobility and independence. Fear not, exercising caution and following the steps below could lower your threat of tripping and falling.

### Steps to preventing falls

Many falls occur inside the home. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control estimates that “nearly 23,000 people over the age of 65 died and 2.4 million were treated” in 2011 for injuries sustained after a fall.

It is easy to understand why falls occur more often inside than outside the home: Home is your haven. It’s where you feel safest. You’re more comfortable there, so you don’t see the hazards that lie in wait around every corner. Ask a relative, friend or occupational therapist to walk through your home with you to assess the most common hazards:

#### Floor missteps

+ **Area rugs**
	- Whether you trip over them or they slip under foot, throw rugs are a menace. Preclude the threat by either removing them so that you don’t trip on them, or place non-slip rug pads under them so that they don’t move underfoot.
+ **Clutter**
	- Are your prized collections exhibited at floor level, or do you kick off your shoes wherever the mood hits – leaving a trail of shoes sprinkled across your floors? Nevertheless, anything on the floor is dangerous. Protect yourself by keeping your floors clutter free.
+ **Wires/cords**
	- They are necessary, but electrical wires or phone cords can easily entangle your feet causing you to trip and fall. To prevent an accident from occurring, tape or tack down all wires and cords out of harm’s way.

#### Staircase stumbles

+ **Objects on the stairs**
	- Are items sitting on your steps waiting for you to take them upstairs? Remove them. For safety sake, keep articles off the steps.
+ **Poorly lit stairs**
	- Low lighting in high-traffic areas is dangerous. To ensure that staircases are well-lit, have a light switch installed at the top and bottom of the stairs. Replace blown bulbs ASAP.
+ **Handrails**
	- Having a secure handrail that runs on both sides of the stairs is best.
	- Fix loose or broken steps and carpeting.

#### Bathroom slips

+ **The tub/shower**
	- Bathrooms are perilous with their hard, slippery surfaces. Use a non-slip mat in the shower, ensuring that it is secure before stepping onto it, or adhere rubber decals to the bottom of the tub.
	- Install grab bars inside and outside of the tub/shower to steady yourself when entering and exiting.

#### Kitchen spills

+ **Step stools**
	- Never use a chair as a step stool.
	- Or ascend a step stool that is unsteady.
	- Have someone spot you while you go up it, while you are on it, and while you descend it.
	- Wipe up spills when they occur, before you slip on them.

#### Bedroom blunders

+ **Bedtime**
	- Make sure that whatever you need on your nightstand is within reach before you get into bed.
	- Be sure that the path from your bed to the door is clear of clutter (see Floor misstep).
	- Add a motion-detecting nightlight between the bed and the door, and from the door to the bathroom.
	- When getting out of bed, roll onto your side, sit up slowly, and place your feet firmly on the floor before standing up.
